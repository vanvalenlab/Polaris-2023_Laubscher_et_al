# Polaris Publication Figures

This repo contains code to reproduce the figures from Laubscher, et al. The scripts to generate the figures are at the top-level directory. Notebooks to perform prediction are available in the *notebooks* folder. The functions for prediction will require an API key for access, available upon reasonable request.
