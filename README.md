# Polaris Publication Figures

This repo contains notebooks to reproduce the figures from Laubscher et al. (2023). The `PolarisPublicationData` object downloads the data required to run these notebooks. The `SpotDetection` application will require an API key for access, available at [users.deepcell.org](users.deepcell.org) for academic users.
